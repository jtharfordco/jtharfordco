- 👋 Hi, I’m @jtharfordco
In 1960, and again in 1964, the American Dental Association confirmed that Crest effectively prevents tooth decay, reporting that “Crest
has been shown to be an effective anticavity dentifrice that can be of significant value when used in a
conscientiously applied program of oral hygiene and regular professional care” in granting its Seal of
Acceptance. In 1976, the American Chemical Society recognized Crest with fluoride as one
of the 100 greatest discoveries of the previous 100 years

"It's some kind of synthetic that's a synthetic"  (Speed Racers circa 1978-79)

it is not generally known and I do not necessarily state it as a fact
that certain citizens posses the ability to quit their bodies for short periods
of time and travel about for the purpose of assaulting their neighbors
